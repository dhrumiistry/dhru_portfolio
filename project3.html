      <h2>Work Project 1 - Manufacturing Data Analysis</h2>
      <p>This project focused gathering data from production operations & gathering inights from it.</p>
      <p>The goal was to identify how many sensors failed weekly & conditions where it is most likely to fail..</p>
      <p>A VBA macro was created to clean the data as during a week around 300 - 500 raw data files are created.</p>
      <p>This macro gathers key data & removes unneeded columns whilst also fetching data from the summary file.</p>
      <p>The data/results then get visualised into a Power BI report for stakeholders to view.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Three distinct customer clusters were identified based on frequency and spending.</li>
      <li>High-value customers showed strong loyalty and responded well to personalized offers.</li>
      <li>Low-frequency shoppers preferred discounts and seasonal promotions.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Tools Used</h2>
      <p>- Excel (data gathering)</p>
      <p>- VBA (macro)</p>
      <p>- Power BI (visualisations & DAX)</p>

      <h2>Work Project 2 - Testing Limit Change</h2>
      <p>This project focused around a proposal of changing the limits within 1 of the testing operations.</p>
      <p>The goal was to see if tweeking the set limits will positive or negatively impact the amount of sensor failures.</p>
      <p>This was done within Power BI using the cleaned data from the previous projects, dropping irrelevant columns however.</p>
      <p>Created DAX measures to allow for the scatter chart to become dynamic.</p>
